          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny‚Äôs worth.

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</span>

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy. 
        </p>

        <span class="parrafo4">
          ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
          find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
          to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
          amazing people. ‚Äù

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        ‚Äú Before joining
        the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
        step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
        staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
        wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
        tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during
        interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
