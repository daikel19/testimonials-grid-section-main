          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny‚Äôs worth.

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</span>

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy. ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
          find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
          to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
          amazing people. ‚Äù

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! ‚Äú Before joining
          the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
          structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
          step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
          only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
          staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
          wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
          tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during
          interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
          multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
